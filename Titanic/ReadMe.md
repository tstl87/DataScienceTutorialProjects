# Kaggle Competition - Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

The title probably gives this away, but this is my attempt at combining the information I've received in my courses to take a crack at this Kaggle competition. The overview of this competition can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview. For a detailed description of my thought process, please read the pdf found in the repository.
